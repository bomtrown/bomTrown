### Key interests that relate to programming

## MATHS! - predicting the future, basically time travel really*
Since doing my mathematical modelling and machine learning modules in the first and second years of my degree, I've had a real fascination with modelling the real world and trying to find optimisations and make predictions about anything and everything initially fresh from my degree using Python and later C++ for those tasty performance improvements!

* I've yet to figure out how to program time travel in C++ or Python yet :(

## Front end and aesthetics in software
I don't want that to mean my skills should stop with the technical however. I believe style and beauty are far more scarce than they could be in the software world, not only for the pure satisfaction but also for the usability, friendliness, and impact of software. People rarely like brutalism in the world (although I should say I definitely have a soft spot for it!) so why is it the default for so much software? HTML, CSS, JS  - I'll get it at some point if I stare at it for long enough surely...

## Music production and custom software creation
I've had a music production hobby forever and ever and ever etc. And from my experience, there comes a time when the off-the-shelf software just doesn't cut it anymore, your weird, overly specific, technical ambitions for the sound you want can't quite be created by something someone else has thought of quite just yet. So being able to make VST's is a skill I'm working towards at the moment. C++, JUCE, and CMake because xCode is just too big!
